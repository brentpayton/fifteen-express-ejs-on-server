      <h4>This site provides an easy way to play a poetry game normally played on paper</h4>

      The game is played like this:
      <ol>
        <li>Create an account and log in or log in with your social media account.</li>
        <li>Click the big green "add a poem" button on the homepage.</li>
        <li>On the "Add a poem" page, you only need to provide two pieces of information:  the poem's title and how may words there will be per line.  I recommend leaving the "words per line" option set to 5 for your first poem.</li>
        <li>Click "submit".</li>
        <li>You'll be taken to your "My Poems" page.  Find the new poem in the list and click on the title.</li>
        <li>You'll be taken to a page that allows you to see the poem's details.  Everything will be blank since the poem will be new.</li>
        <li>Click on "Edit"</li>
        <li>On the edit page you'll be able to change the poem's title and you'll be able to add the poem's first line.</li>
        <li>Fill in the blanks and click "Submit"</li>
        <li>The next person who edits the poem will see only the fifth word you wrote and five new blanks for the next line.  They fill out the blanks and click "submit"</li>
        <li>Lines are submitted until 15 have been completed.  The poem will now show as "complete" on the homepage and everyone will be able to read the whole thing.</li>
      </ol>

      In case you're ever interested in playing the offline version of the game, the rules are slightly different:
      <ol>
        <li>Each player begins by writing 5 words on the first line of a piece of paper and a sixth word on the second line.</li>
        <li>The sheets of paper are then folded such that only the word on the second line is visible.</li>
        <li>Players exchange the sheets of paper with each other.  This should be as random as possible.  Don't just pass to the left or right.</li>
        <li>For the remainder of the game, each player completes the line given to them by adding four words before adding a fifth to the next line.  The sheet of paper is folded again and passed to a different player.</li>
        <li>When the sheets of paper are full or a time limit has expired, the players unfold the pieces of paper and read the poems out loud.</li>
      </ol>
